                <p>My name is Natsuki Harvey. I was born in Yokohama, Japan to a Japanese mother and American Father. I lived in Japan till 2011 when the Earthquake struck and forced my father's company to move us to the states. 
                    I have 2 younger siblings and I just got married to my wife, Jena, who I met at the Defense Language Institute where she learned Chinese and I learned Farsi and Pashto. 
                    I am coming up to my 3rd year of my 6 year contract with the Air Force. I am a cyber systems operator operating on legacy
                equipment which maintains the communication lines for two of the three nuclear triad within the DOD. This sounds much more important than it is. </p>
                <p>My wife and I just recently bought a house together in Omaha, NE and we have worked on it ever since moving in, however within the first week disaster struck us as I cut my big toe with 
                the lawn mower. I have been on a knee scooter and on convalescent leave for the last 1.5 months and have not been able to do much since the incident. I hope to get back to fixing the house and doing more 
                as my toe heals from the injury.</p>
                <p>I plan on getting out of the Air Force a few years after my wife as my contract states. Afterwards we would like to possibly move to either Japan or somewhere warmer since Omaha is very 
                cold in the winter and far from family in every direction. In terms of employment, I am hoping this degree and my experiences in the Air Force will help me get a decent job working in anything cyber related,
                    however I do not see myself doing cyber in the long run well into my 50s and 60s hopefully. I am not sure what I want to do as a profession when I get older after I have kids but I just want to provide for my wife and future kids. 
                    I would like to personally work on a car or truck as a hobby as I did when I was in high school with my Jeeps. </p>
